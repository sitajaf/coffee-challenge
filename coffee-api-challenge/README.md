- A deployed API (e.g. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com))
- Submitting a solution as a pair

### To Submit
Feel free to paste a link to your solution github repo into the code challenge email thread or email one of the Software Shokunin Community organisers directly with a link.  

If you donâ€™t want to post code publicly we still encourage you to give the challenge a go!  Use the problem to exercise your skills, take your brain for a jog and work those typing muscles!!


Peace and love fellow Shokunin
